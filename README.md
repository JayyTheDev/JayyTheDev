Note to self: You got this! Trust the process, Trust in Gods Plan for he is the only one who want's the best for you. And Jhonas, Good Luck on accomplishing your coding adventure and I hope to see you,
on top one day as an expert in Game Development and Project Management.

Thanks for reading everyone, and hope you enjoy many projects coming in the near future. :)
